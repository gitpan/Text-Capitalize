NAME
    Text::Capitalize - capitalize strings ("uGly STrIngS" becomes "Cool
    Strings")

SYNOPSIS
       use Text::Capitalize;
       print &capitalize ("...and justice for all"), "\n";
       print &capitalize ("kill 'em all"), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Provides title-like formatting for strings. Originally created to put
    pretty looking names to MP3 files (first-letter-uppercase). Title-like
    formatting consists in converting strings to lowercase and then
    uppercase first letters of each word.

    Examples of title formatting:

    'overkill' becomes 'Overkill'
    'KiLLiNG TiMe' becomes 'Killing Time'
USAGE
    Text::Capitalize provides only one sub-routine to process strings:

    capitalize (string): returns re-formatted string.
INSTALLATION
    Just execute:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make

    And, as root (su):

       make install
