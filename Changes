     Cleaned up documentation slightly, belatedly added the
     above remark "0.03", which describes the version 0.3 release.

     Fixed bad bug: all routines now use localized $_, to
     keep from clobbering $_ in calling code.

     Added tests for random_case and scramble_case.

     Bug fix release for the test suite: if the current
     locale can't deal with the international characters
     use in some of the test cases, those particular test
     cases will be skipped.

     All bug fix releases for the tests, redesigning them
     to make them insensitive to the set-up of locales.
